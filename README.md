# Titanic-Survival-Data

Conducted analysis on IPython Notebook using Python's NumPy, Python, Matplotlib, and various other libraries to visualize relationships of different attributes of a titanic dataset

How to run:

Anaconda
The file runs on Jupyter Notebook, so I recommend using Anaconda (Download link: https://www.continuum.io/downloads) as it installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

1. Download Anaconda
2. Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded
3. Open command Prompt/Terminal
4. To make sure the Anaconda is up to date, run these two lines of code:
    conda update conda
    conda update anaconda

IPython Notebook
IPython notebooks allows you to combine code, plots, output, and descriptions in one easily readable document.

1. Download the ipython notebook file: Tony_Chu_Titanic_Survival.ipynb.
2. Save the file and titanic_data.csv file in the same folder.
3. Open your Command Prompt (PC) or terminal (Mac or Linux)
4. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the IPython notebook file.
5. Run the command jupyter notebook Tony_Chu_Titanic_Survival.ipynb in your terminal. Do not close your terminal or command prompt.
6. BOOM! Hope you enjoy!
